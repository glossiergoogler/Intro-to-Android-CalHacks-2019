# [CalHacks 2019] Introduction to Android

**Foreward**

Fall 2019 CalHacks, October 26th 4-6pm.

This workshop will walk participants through building a simple Android app that showcases Android fundamentals and programming practices. This will provide you with a solid foundation to build off of when you develop more complex applications that go beyond the scope of this workshop. Open to all levels of programmers, experience with Java recommended.

Q&A following the workshop is open for deeper questions about Android, questions about our experience navigating the hiring process, and our day-to-day lives as engineers :)

**Setup**: Please install Android Studio. Download [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). Please do this ASAP, *preferably before the workshop*.

Workshop lead by Jessica Zheng and Sujeeth Jinesh.

## Additional Resources

The codelab I recommend the most for learning about Android in-depth is the one provided by Google themselves: [Android Developer Fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2). It is well-documented, maintained and kept-up-to-date, and even has a series of accompanying [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlyCyjh2pUe9wv-hU4my-Nen_SvXIzxGB).
